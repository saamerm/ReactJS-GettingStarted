# ReactJS-GettingStarted
 Just dipping my finders into ReactJS, following the FCC tutorial videos

* To create this repo, I started with a blank Github repo directory and then added a React .gitignore file to it, copied from [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/.gitignore)
* Then I followed [these steps](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) create my first react act as shown below
* Inside my GitHub repo directory, I performed `npx create-react-app my-app`
  * If you get a message saying "command not found" in your terminal, you need to install some stuff first. If you want to use the terminal then get homebrew first `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` which takes a while, and then get node `brew install node`
  * Make sure that it works by trying `node -v` or `npm -v` or `npx -v`
* The jump into the directory of your "my-app" using `cd my-app` and then build the website using `npm start`
* And it popped open my browser with the spinning react icon.
